## üîç Overview

ProofWork is a decentralized reputation system built on blockchain technology, designed to solve the trust problem in Web3 freelancer marketplaces. By leveraging immutable on-chain reviews, verified work history, and AI-powered reputation scoring, ProofWork creates transparent and trustworthy freelancer profiles that cannot be tampered with or falsified.

**The Problem**: Traditional freelancer platforms rely on centralized databases for reputation, which can be manipulated, lost, or controlled by a single entity. Web3 projects need trustless verification of talent.

**The Solution**: ProofWork stores all reputation data on the blockchain with cryptographic verification of reviews, enabling anyone to independently verify a freelancer's reputation without relying on a central authority.

## üåü Key Features

- **Blockchain Authentication**: Connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect, or other Web3 wallets for secure identity verification
- **Immutable Reviews**: All feedback is stored on-chain and cannot be altered or deleted
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Reviews are signed by clients' wallets, ensuring authenticity
- **AI Reputation Scoring**: Machine learning algorithms analyze on-chain activity to detect fraudulent reviews and provide objective reputation scores
- **Proof of Work History**: Verified project completion through cryptographic attestations
- **Sybil Resistance**: Prevents fake accounts and review manipulation through advanced identity verification
- **Interoperable Profiles**: Freelancer reputation works across multiple platforms through our open API
- **Customizable Criteria**: Businesses can filter freelancers based on specific reputation metrics
- **Portable Reputation**: Freelancers own their reputation data and can use it anywhere
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Optional privacy features for sensitive project details

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ProofWork uses a modern three-tier architecture:

1. **Smart Contracts (Blockchain Layer)**
   - ReviewSystem.sol: Handles storing and retrieving reviews
   - ProfileRegistry.sol: Manages freelancer profiles and verification
   - ReputationScoring.sol: Implements the reputation algorithm

2. **Backend (API Layer)**
   - Node.js/Express server
   - Blockchain integration with ethers.js
   - AI reputation analysis
   - Authentication services

3. **Frontend (Presentation Layer)**
   - Next.js React application
   - Web3 wallet integration
   - Responsive Tailwind CSS design
   - Interactive freelancer profiles

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- npm v8 or higher
- MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
- MongoDB (for backend)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proofwork.git
   cd proofwork
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   # Edit frontend/.env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start local blockchain**
   ```bash
   npm run start:blockchain
   ```

5. **Deploy contracts locally**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:contracts
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application

## üîó Smart Contract System

ProofWork's core functionality is powered by Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum and compatible EVM chains.

### Contract Overview

1. **ReviewSystem.sol**
   - Stores client reviews of freelancers
   - Implements review verification using cryptographic signatures
   - Prevents modification or deletion of reviews
   - Calculates average ratings and maintains review counts

2. **ProfileRegistry.sol**
   - Manages freelancer profile information
   - Handles identity verification
   - Links profiles to wallet addresses
   - Stores skills, experience, and other profile details

3. **ReputationScoring.sol**
   - Aggregates review data
   - Implements weight calculations for different factors
   - Combines on-chain signals for a comprehensive reputation score
   - Uses upgradable patterns for algorithm improvements

### Contract Interaction

The smart contracts interact with the frontend/backend through:

1. **Reading data**:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Fetching a freelancer's reviews
   const reviews = await reviewSystemContract.getFreelancerReviews(freelancerAddress);
   ```

2. **Writing data**:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Submitting a review (client-side)
   const tx = await reviewSystemContract.submitReview(
     freelancerAddress,
     rating,
     commentHash,
     signature
   );
   await tx.wait();
   ```

3. **Events**:
   The contracts emit events for important actions, which the backend listens for:
   ```solidity
   event ReviewSubmitted(address indexed client, address indexed freelancer, uint8 rating);
   ```

## üíª Frontend Application

The frontend is built with Next.js and provides an intuitive interface for:

- Browsing freelancer profiles
- Viewing reputation scores and reviews
- Submitting new reviews
- Connecting Web3 wallets
- Managing freelancer profiles

### Key Components

- **Web3Provider**: Handles wallet connections and blockchain interactions
- **FreelancerCard**: Displays freelancer information with reputation scores
- **ReviewModal**: Allows clients to submit blockchain-verified reviews
- **Dashboard**: Shows relevant information for freelancers and clients

## üîß Backend API

The backend provides:

- API endpoints for frontend data
- AI reputation analysis
- Indexing of blockchain events
- Authentication services
- IPFS integration for storing larger data

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/freelancers` | List freelancers with filters |
| `/api/freelancers/:address` | Get specific freelancer details |
| `/api/reviews/submit` | Submit a new review |
| `/api/auth/nonce` | Get nonce for wallet signature |
| `/api/reputation/analyze` | Get AI-generated reputation insights |

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploying Smart Contracts
